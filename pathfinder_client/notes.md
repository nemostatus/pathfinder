//this will be done in gamesactions 
//starting the game should make a POST request creating a new game with the users_id or user.id handles rails
//this action should also update redux state
// this will be done when create new game button is clicked which will be somewhere
//some divs in these componenets will update state so some will need state and others wont they will event handlers
//oonclick handlers getting actions from mapdispatch to props
//goals => create a hook where it checks if hearts are empty, if hearts empty in state, gameover screen,
//clicking on a game should fetch that specific game by it's id and set the redux state to that, idk, I'll need to experiemnt
//with this and research the proper way

Goals



would be nice section
adding more icons on screen
not priority but adding background pics for each scenario

ok so hows this working i have the rails db, this will persist any changes due to actions triggered  on click  events,figure out how i want to display current game info which part of app is responsible for that...
options 
this is tricky
if localstorage isnt allowed, checkout redux persist



GOALS
----------------------------------------
1. Creating login form so once a user is registered they can find their acct and see their games A
2. make sure localstorage is ok to use compared to redux persist library B
3. Think of how you can make this app more dynamic C
4. Add backgrounds to pages G
5. Think of how to add actions, persist state, change game in db with PUT request D
6. turned based boss battle system E boss fight component?
7. if hearts gone, show game over screen F
8. make items and array, if item exists more or less options
9. be realistic with time and set priorities like ensuring requirements are met and code is solid so ill do that now alphabetically *
