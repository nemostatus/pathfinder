//this will be done in gamesactions 
//starting the game should make a POST request creating a new game with the users_id or user.id handles rails
//this action should also update redux state
// this will be done when create new game button is clicked which will be somewhere
//some divs in these componenets will update state so some will need state and others wont they will event handlers
//oonclick handlers getting actions from mapdispatch to props
//goals => create a hook where it checks if hearts are empty, if hearts empty in state, gameover screen,
//clicking on a game should fetch that specific game by it's id and set the redux state to that, idk, I'll need to experiemnt
//with this and research the proper way
