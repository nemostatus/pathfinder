                You run into the cave to see the princess being surrounded by a pack of mountain lions! As you see them
                growling and swiping at her as she is tucked into the only safe spot of the cave, you shout and charge forward.
                Swinging furiously around you. As your sword is about to make contact with the lions head it passes through
                instead and you quickly realize the lions aren't there at all. In fact all you see now is an old witch
                saying "help, help!" in the exact voice as the princess. Petrified, you try to swing your sword but realize it's
                turned into a snake and it swiftly bites your neck. In your final moments you hear the cackling of the witch 
                echo throughout the cave.

                GAME OVER
