                  and offer him some food from your pouch. As he consumes the food, he starts giggling like a madman!
                  He looks at you and says " You've done it! You've broken the curse that wretched witch put on me.
                  You see I crossed her path on this very road and she cursed me to sit on this log until someone 
                  was kind enough to help. I thought I would never be set free! Here take this for your helping me 
                  brave knight!"
