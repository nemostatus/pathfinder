                  gradually becoming darker and more narrow. Keeping your cool you realize the only way out is to retreat 
                  out the way you arrived. As you turn around you see a wall of thick spiderwebs strewn around encompassing
                the path. You soon find yourself enveloped and cocooned in the web as a giant spider reveals itself and 
                you fight valiantly to no avail. You take your final breath hoping the kingdom realizes you fought until the 
                end.
