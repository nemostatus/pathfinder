                  your vision grows blurry from exhaustion. As you defeat the last goblin you check on the damsel. 
                  "You foolish knight!" She shrieks. The damsel turns to reveal herself as a goblin and knocks you out with a club.
                  You wake up to find your sword and horse have been taken and the goblins are gone! You continue toward 
                  the forest to see 2 paths. One looks like the main entrance and another is a strange looking shortcut.
